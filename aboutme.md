title: About me
---

Remember lab manuals? Those nicely bound notebooks you used in college to document lab experiments? If you were born in the 70's and went to a technical college like me, then you probably do. For years I've used a plain text file as my "lab manual" in which I documented pretty much anything I learned while building stuff with computers. I called my text file "WORKHISTORY" and I made its contents searchable with keywords that summarized each entry. When I started working for [MapR](http://www.mapr.com) in 2015, I knew I would be learning a lot of new stuff and I figured this would be a good opportunity to publish a curated version of WORKHISTORY. 

I blog for a variety of reasons:

- ***I like to teach.*** My work feels more worthwhile if I am ultimately sharing newfound knowledge with others. 
- ***I enjoy typesetting.*** From Latex to Jekyll, I've always enjoyed creating well formatted web pages with beautiful fonts, images, and technical content.
- ***It helps me showcase my work.*** For the same reasons that artists use portfolios to showcase their style and best work, my blog helps me show potential employers what I know and how I communicate.
