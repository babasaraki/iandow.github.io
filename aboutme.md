title: About me
---

My name is Ian Downard. I am a technical evangelist for [MapR Technologies](http://www.mapr.com). My career has focused on developing tools for optimizing the performance of applications. Currently, I'm focused on finding and promoting ways businesses can be successful with big data applications. 

I work from home, so I make an extra effort to engage with people in person. For example, I regularly attend my local Java and big data user groups, and I occasionally meet with a [career coach](http://www.portlandcoachingcollective.com/faqs/) who helps me gain a deeper understanding of myself and align what I value with what I do in my career.

I currently live in Portland, Oregon. I grew up in rural Missouri in an old house overlooking the beautiful Bourbeuse River near Union, Missouri. My participation with social media is primarily on Twitter [@iandownard](http://twitter.com/iandownard).

### Portfolio

Artists keep a portfolio of their work, and I've often wondered why more software geeks don't do the same thing. Here are a few examples of work I've published which I enjoy showing off.

* [www.mthoodlookouts.com](http://www.mthoodlookouts.com) - A hobby project. This little web app helps me be the first to know when sites on recreation.gov become available to reserve. It also tweets notifications to [@mthoodlookouts](https://twitter.com/mthoodlookouts).

* [appinternals.trafficmanager.net](http://appinternals.trafficmanager.net) - An interactive demo for performance monitoring software from Riverbed Technology. This is also a good demo of web annotations from www.walkme.com.

* [Blog](http://www.riverbed.com/blogs/authors/ian-downard.html) - Miscellaneous blog articles for Riverbed.

* [Video](http://www.voltaicsystems.com/blog/solar-powered-chicken-coop/) - Evidence of my chicken coop madness.
