My name is Ian Downard. I am a technical evangelist and software developer for MapR Technologies, Inc. My career has focused on developing tools for optimizing the performance of networks and applications. Currently, he's focused on finding and promoting new ways businesses can be successful using MapR's Converged Data Platform for Big Data applications. I frequently attend the Java and Azure user groups in Portland, Oregon. I grew up in rural Missouri, in an old house situated next to the Burbouse River. My participation with social media is primarily on Twitter @iandownard.
