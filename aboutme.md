title: About me
---

Remember lab manuals? Those nicely bound notebooks you used in college to document lab experiments? If you were born in the 70's and went to a technical college like me, then you probably do. For years I've used a plain text file as my "lab manual" in which I documented pretty much anything I learned while building stuff with computers. I called my text file "WORKHISTORY", and I made its contents searchable with keywords that summarized each entry. When I started working for [MapR](http://www.mapr.com) in 2015, I knew I would be learning a lot of new stuff and I figured this would be a good opportunity to publish a curated version of WORKHISTORY. That is what motivated me to start this blog. 

I blog for a variety of reasons:

- ***I like to teach.*** My work feels more worthwhile if I am ultimately sharing newfound knowledge with others. 
- ***I think it's pretty.*** From Latex to Jekyll, I've always enjoyed creating well formatted web pages with beautiful fonts, images, and technical content.
- ***Because of job insecurity.*** The nature of at-will employment has ingrained within me a sense of replaceability. So, for the same reasons that artists carry a portfolio to interviews, I keep this blog as evidence I can use to show potential employers what I know and how I communicate.

I am currently a product engineer for [MapR Technologies](http://www.mapr.com) where I focus on streaming, machine learning, and creating awesome demos!
