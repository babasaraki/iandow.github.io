title: Predicting Time-Series Data in OpenTSDB with RNNs in Tensorflow

I've been learning a lot of really interesting stuff about time-series data, lately. Over the past month I've learned how to consume Factory IoT sensor data from an MQTT server, process it in StreamSets, persist it in OpenTSDB, visualize it in Grafana, and forecast it with Tensorflow.  It's really amazing how this all fits together.  I'm going to focus this blog post on the Tensorflow part.

# OpenTSDB 

OpenTSDB is a specialize database for time-series data. It has a really nice REST API which allows you to do things like, create metrics, read metric values, list metrics, etc.  I use `curl` when working with REST APIs. It often takes me some trial-and-error to figure out the proper `curl` syntax, so here are some examples that should help anyone just getting started with OpenTSDB:

Here's how to write a random metric value to opentsdb:

```
curl -X POST --data '{"metric": "sys.ian.test", "timestamp": '`date +%s`',"value": '$RANDOM',"tags": {"host": "web01","dc": "lga"}}' "http://localhost:4242/api/put"
```

Here's how to query OpenTSDB to see what metrics are available. Run this in a web browser, not with curl or wget:

```
        http://localhost:4242/api/suggest?type=metrics&max=10000
```

Here's how to query all the time series data for a metric and pretty print json:

``` 
    curl http://nodeb:4242/api/query?start=1h-ago&m=sum:sys.ian.test | jq
```

For more information about the OpenTSDB REST API, see

# Forcasting time-series data with RNNs in Tensorflow

Justin Brandenburg, a data scientist with MapR, posted an excellent blog describing how to predict a sequence of time-series values using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). His blog is at
[https://mapr.com/blog/deep-learning-tensorflow/](https://mapr.com/blog/deep-learning-tensorflow/).

He also posted accompanying code, showing the RNN in action with Tensorflow. That code is at
[https://github.com/JustinBurg/IoT_Predictive_Maintenance_Demo](https://github.com/JustinBurg/IoT_Predictive_Maintenance_Demo).

## Jupyter Notebook

The following Jupyter notebook shows how I adapted Justin's code to predict values for IoT sensor data in OpenTSDB. This notebook is intended to be run with a `python3` kernel.

I've spent zero time trying to improve the accuracy of this model, so the actual predictions are pretty poor, but since it runs, I'm happy!
